# Lesson 2: Data Models, Relationships, and Schemas

In this class, students will learn how to use more complex SQL queries to retrieve information across tables, and interact with data including write operations.

Objective: Students should be able to build CRUD functionality using SQL statements, including INSERT INTO, UPDATE and DELETE. Students should also be able to create an entity relationship diagram based on a qualitative description of data requirements, and translate that into a MySQL database schema.

## Homework

For this week's homework:

Using an entity relationship diagram, design the data model for an application of your choice; this could be anything, but previous students have used a small business (with staff, offices, and job titles), a library (with books, genres, racks, members, and a borrowing log), or a farm (with animals, barns, and farmers). Your application must include at least one many-to-many relationship and any supporting tables (associative entities) that are needed. The entity relationship diagram must describe what tables you will need, the columns in these tables, which column is the primary key, and the relationships between tables.

Next, using the entity relationship diagram as a starting point, write all the necessary `CREATE TABLE` statements to create all tables and relationships (foreign key constraints) for this data model.

Submit an image or PDF of your entity relationship diagram, and a `.sql` file with the `CREATE TABLE` statements.
